# Mailmurder

Mailmurder uses mutt to let Lisp programs send email. If all you need
is to blindly send email from your program this might save you the 20
or so minutes it would take to write this yourself. If you need to do
anything more elaborate, keep looking (or send a pull request, idk).

I made this for myself so if even just one other person finds this
even just slightly useful then I'm more than happy.

## Requirements

The terminal mail program Mutt must be installed and configured.

## Why is it called Mailmurder?

In Sweden and Denmark the national post company is called
PostNord. PostNord has a pretty bad reputation due to poor handling of
packages and delays. People have jokingly called it "PostMord", "mord"
being Swedish for "murder". I felt this was an appropriate name for an
email library that isn't very good.
